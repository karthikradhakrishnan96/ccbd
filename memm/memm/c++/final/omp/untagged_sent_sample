Rudolph Agnew , 55 years old and former chairman of Consolidated Gold Fields PLC , was named *-1 a nonexecutive director of this British industrial conglomerate .
A form of asbestos once used * * to make Kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed * to it more than 30 years ago , researchers reported 0 *T*-1 .
The asbestos fiber , crocidolite , is unusually resilient once it enters the lungs , with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that *T*-1 show up decades later , researchers said 0 *T*-2 .
Lorillard Inc. , the unit of New York-based Loews Corp. that *T*-2 makes Kent cigarettes , stopped using crocidolite in its Micronite cigarette filters in 1956 .
Although preliminary findings were reported *-2 more than a year ago , the latest results appear in today 's New England Journal of Medicine , a forum likely * to bring new attention to the problem .
A Lorillard spokewoman said , `` This is an old story .
We 're talking about years ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties .
There is no asbestos in our products now . ''
Neither Lorillard nor the researchers who *T*-3 studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the Kent cigarettes .
`` We have no useful information on whether users are at risk , '' said *T*-1 James A. Talcott of Boston 's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute .
Dr. Talcott led a team of researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the medical schools of Harvard University and Boston University .
The Lorillard spokeswoman said 0 asbestos was used *-1 in `` very modest amounts '' in * making paper for the filters in the early 1950s and replaced *-1 with a different type of filter in 1956 .
From 1953 to 1955 , 9.8 billion Kent cigarettes with the filters were sold *-3 , the company said 0 *T*-1 .
Among 33 men who *T*-4 worked closely with the substance , 28 *ICH*-1 have died -- more than three times the expected number .
Four of the five surviving workers have asbestos-related diseases , including three with recently diagnosed cancer .
The total of 18 deaths from malignant mesothelioma , lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than * expected *?* , the researchers said 0 *T*-1 .
`` The morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who *T*-5 study asbestos-related diseases , '' said *T*-1 Dr. Talcott .
The percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the West Groton , Mass. , paper factory appears *-1 to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied * in Western industrialized countries , he said 0 *T*-2 .
